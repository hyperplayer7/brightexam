# AI Usage Disclosure

AI tools were used during development of this project to accelerate implementation and documentation tasks.

## How AI was used
- Antigravity/Codex assistance for:
  - project scaffolding and boilerplate generation
  - repetitive CRUD/controller/policy/service templates
  - draft test scaffolding and documentation drafting

## Human oversight
- All AI-generated output was reviewed and edited by a human.
- Business rules, API behavior, and final structure were validated against project requirements.
- Final acceptance decisions and repository commits were human-controlled.

## What was not purely AI generated
- Requirement interpretation and final trade-off decisions.
- Manual review, corrections, and alignment with actual repo behavior.
- Final submission packaging decisions.

## Data handling
- No production secrets or sensitive personal data were intentionally shared with AI tools.
- Local development credentials are sample/test credentials only.
